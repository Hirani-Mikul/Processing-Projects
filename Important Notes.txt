I.3: Gaussian Distribution - The Nature of Code

About the Gaussian Distribution.
- Show result as you wanted by choosing the Mean and Standard Deviation
- Mean descibes the most population.
- Standard Deviation is about spreading the value over a long spread, over laying.


I.4: Custom Distribution - The Nature of Code

Example:

let random1 = random(0, 100);
let random2 = random(0, 100);

let y = random1 * random1;

if (random2 < y) {
   execute code;
} else {
   go back and loop again and find the number that satisfy the condition.
   or skip the this code execution;
}
